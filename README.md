# EXP.-6-MEASUREMENT-OF-RESISTANCE--USING-KELVINS-DOUBLE-BRIDGE-BRIDGE-2

## Aim:
To determine the value of a very low unknown resistance (S) using the Kelvin Double Bridge method.

## Apparatus Required:

DC supply (12V)
Kelvin Double Bridge setup
Rheostat (Rs)
Ammeter
Voltmeter / Millivoltmeter
Unknown low resistance (S)
Connecting wires

## Procedure:

Set the voltage (V = 12V) and switch on the board. Keep Switch (S) in Short mode and adjust the rheostat (Rs) to maintain the current at 2A, 3A, 4A, or 5A.
Set Switch (S) to Open mode and set the low resistance value within 0.001 to 0.01 Ω from the "Set The Unknown Resistance S" box.
Set Switch (S) to Bridge mode and Switch (K) to Open mode.
Vary the values of RA, RB, Ra, and Rb from the control box or directly enter the values until the millivoltmeter shows zero deflection.
Now, set Switch (K) to Close mode and again vary RA, RB, Ra, and Rb to achieve zero deflection.
Once "NULL" is achieved, click on Calculate in the "Calculated Unknown Resistance Value" box to obtain the resistance value of the unknown resistor (S).

## Result:

The value of the unknown low resistance (S) was successfully measured using the Kelvin Double Bridge method.
